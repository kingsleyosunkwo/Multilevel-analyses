# OPENING AND SAVING FILES
```
// Open a data file
use "S:\Kingsley Osunkwo Files\Linear regression_And_Multilevel_models-DataExerciseV1.dta", clear

// Save the dataset
save "S:\Kingsley Osunkwo Files\Linear regression_And_Multilevel_models-DataExerciseV1.dta", replace
```

# DATA MANIPULATION
Calculating Household Income at the Individual Level
Refer to the OECD Note on Equivalence Scales for guidance.

Removing Missing Data
```
drop if ep005_ < 0
```

Keeping Specific Countries
```
keep if country == 20 | country == 11
```

Generating New Variables
```
gen self_perceived_health = sphus
replace self_perceived_health = . if sphus < 0

gen phy_health = self_perceived_health
replace phy_health = 1 if self_perceived_health == 5
replace phy_health = 5 if self_perceived_health == 1
```

# REGRESSION MODELS
# POOLED OLS
```
reg Y X1 X2 X3
```
# YEAR/WAVE-SPECIFIC OLS
```
reg Y X1 X2 X3 if int_year == XXXX
```
# MULTILEVEL MODELING
```

```

# EXAMPLES OF ADDITIONAL COMMANDS
Filtering Data
```
// Keep observations for Switzerland
keep if country == 20

// Drop countries
drop if country == 20
```
Tabulate and Summarize
```
tab country
su sphus
```
